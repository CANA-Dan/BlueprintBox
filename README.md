# Blueprint Box
 A collection of nodes to analyze or work with data. its more or less whatever I need at the time.
 contains stuff for FFT analysis (as well as texture output)
 some radix sorting functions
 some specfic casts
 midi importing
 and other random junk

Note that this plugin requires the [Audio Analysis Tools Plugin](https://github.com/gtreshchev/AudioAnalysisTools) (and by extension the [Runtime Audio Importer Plugin](https://github.com/gtreshchev/RuntimeAudioImporter)) for the spectrogram generation stuff in this plugin. Both are free and very nice plugins.
