# Analysis Plugin
 A collection of nodes to analyze or work with data.

Note that this plugin requires the [Audio Analysis Tools Plugin](https://github.com/gtreshchev/AudioAnalysisTools) (and by extension the [Runtime Audio Importer Plugin](https://github.com/gtreshchev/RuntimeAudioImporter)) for the spectrogram generation stuff in this plugin. Both are free and very nice plugins.
