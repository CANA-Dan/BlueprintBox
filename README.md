# Blueprint Box
A collection of nodes to analyze or work with data. its more or less whatever I need at the time.
 
contains stuff for FFT analysis (as well as texture output)

some radix sorting functions

some specfic casts

midi importing

and other random junk

Note that this plugin requires the [Audio Analysis Tools Plugin](https://github.com/gtreshchev/AudioAnalysisTools) (and by extension the [Runtime Audio Importer Plugin](https://github.com/gtreshchev/RuntimeAudioImporter)) for the spectrogram generation stuff in this plugin. Both are free and very nice plugins.

## how to install
Grab the source and put in in your Plugins folder. If you dont have one, make one in the same folder that contains your project files/folders. this plugin will require you to build using visual studio.

Heres how to [setup visual studio](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine) to work with unreal engine, and heres how to [convert a BP project to C++](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/how-can-i-convert-a-blueprint-project-to-c-project-in-ue5/526755)

compatabile with UE 4.27, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4. its probably compatable with ealier than 4.27, but that is untested.
